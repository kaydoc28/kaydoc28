### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my About me page! 


My name is Kayleigh Dougherty and I have a passion for Data Analytics. I found my passion for data analytics at my previous position as an Account Specialist. I used many reporting tools such as Power BI, Metabase, and Excel in order to drive revenue and business goals that resulted in $3M. I am also a great communicator as I have onboarded and trained over 100 employees. I have discovered my natural strength of identifying themes, problems, and solutions as well as my love and thirst for knowledge. My strengths, experience, and recent certification in data analytics  has transformed me into a data analyst that is looking to grow my skillset, as well as grow with a company. 

- ðŸŒ± I have recently graduated with a Data Analytics Certification and am looking to use my new tool belt.
